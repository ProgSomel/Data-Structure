# What is a Stack?
A stack is a **linear data structure** that stores elements in a **Last-In**, **First-Out (LIFO)** order.
- **LIFO:** The last element you put in is the first one you get out.

**Real-life Analogy**
Think of a stack of plates:
- You can only take the top plate off (pop).
- You add a new plate on top (push).
- You cannot access plates below the top directly.
