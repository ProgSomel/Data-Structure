# What is Binary Tree

A Binary Tree is a special type of tree data structure where each node has **at most two children**. These two children are usually referred to as the **left child** and **right child**.

- **Each node:** Can have 0, 1, or 2 children (never more than two).
- The tree starts with a root node (topmost node).
- **Left child:** The node connected on the left.
- **Right child:** The node connected on the right.
