# Complexity of insert in heap --> O(h), Here h is the Height of the Binary Tree, We know MaxHeap and MinHeap the Binary Tree will be Complete Binary Tree and Height of Complete Binary Tree is logN--> So Complexity of insert a value in Heap is --> O(logN)
for 1 insert, Complexity is logN;
for N insert, Complexity is NlogN;
