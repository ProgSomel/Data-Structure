# What is heap
- **maxHeap** --> gives max value; //best complexity than sorting
- **minHeap** --> gives min value; //best complexity than sorting

A heap is a special type of binary tree used in computer science, mainly for priority queues. It satisfies the heap property:
- **For a Max Heap:** Every parent node’s value is greater than or equal to its children’s values.
- **For a Min Heap:** Every parent node’s value is less than or equal to its children’s values.
