# What is Priority Queue
A Priority Queue is a special type of queue where each element has a priority, and elements are removed based on priority, not just the order they were added.

Think of it like a hospital emergency room:

- Patients with more urgent conditions (higher priority) are treated first,
- Even if they arrived later than someone with a less urgent case.

**Key Points:**
- **Normal Queue** → **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) — like people waiting in a line.
- **Priority Queue** → The element with the highest priority is removed first.
- **In C++**, the STL priority_queue is usually implemented as a max-heap by default.
