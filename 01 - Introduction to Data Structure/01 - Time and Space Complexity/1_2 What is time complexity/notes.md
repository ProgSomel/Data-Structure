# What is time complexity(Depends on loop) 

**Time complexity means in the respect of input, how many operations it is doing**

**Time complexity does not work on Time it works on stepa or operations**

```c++
for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    cout << "Hello World"
}
```
In the above code, if there is n = 20, then Hello World wil print 20 times, so there is 20 operations for this code. So the time complexity of this code is **O(n)**
